			Typically these cores are restricted to dead planets where they will be unable to expand, as there is no currently known way to destroy them. \
			We cannot currently track the cores location at this time as it seems to have noticed and evolved to stop us, now seemingly invisible to any of our methods. \
			It is believed that we will be able to spot the core once it enters any solar system, giving very little time to prepare against it. \
			Ensure that you are prepared at all times to fight back as evacuation requests will be denied due to the danger of spreading this infection."
